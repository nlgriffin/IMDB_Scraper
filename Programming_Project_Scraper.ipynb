    "<ol> In this part of the project we use web scraping to gather data about all of the query result movies from IMDB's web page in a format that will be usable for analysis. In particular, we want to collect information about movie title, movie's genres, country, language, filming location, production company, runtime, budget information, release date, directors, writers, stars acting in the movie, rating, review count and finally mpaa ratings. </ol>\n",
    "<ol>  Since our goal is to scrape information from multiple webpages with the same html structure, first we had to understand the websites structure. To do this, we used Chrome's Developer tools to inspect the structure of only one page. By right clicking and hitting inspect you can see the HTML line that corresponds to the part of webpage you clicked at. There are lots of HTML lines nested within each tag and for each feature we found unique identifier of information we wanted to extract. Then, in order to get the content of the webpage, we downloaded the pages that we wanted to scrape by using the request library. The library makes a get request to IMDB's server and downloads the HTML contents of a given web page. After we run the request using requests.get method, we get back a response object that has a status_code, which equals to 200 if the page gets downloaded successfully. This enabled us to include error catching into our code and return a warning whenever web pages did not get downloaded successfully (status_code does not equal 200).  Next step is to extract relevant text from the downloaded HTML documents. We used BeautifulSoup library for to parse these documents. In order to do this, we first created an instance of the BeautifulSoup class, which gives us a BeautifulSoup object. BeautifulSoup object has a nested data structure. The tag objects within this nested structure allowed us to extract the relevant information. We used find_all method to find all instances of a tag in a webpage. Find_all returns a list, therefore we used list indexing to extract relevant text by using text method. We also used find_all method to extract by class, for example in line 39 we search for any div that has class being 'see-more inline canwrap'. Once we are able to uniquely identify how to get each piece of information:</ol>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>we can loop through multiple urls,</li>\n",
    "<li>place get requests within the loop for each page</li>\n",
    "<li>convert the response's html content to beautiful soup object</li>\n",
    "<li>extract all containers from this object by using find_all method, if there is no information than continue to the next variable</li>\n",
    "<li>use list indexing to access information</li>\n",
    "<li>and save this information into pandas’ data frame.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\t\n",
    "<ol>At the end of this process, we have a data frame with each row representing information on each movie scraped and each column corresponding to the variable we scraped.</ol>"
