    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "IMDB offers downloadable datasets, but all of these are limited in scope. https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/ None contain any more than 8 features, and it would be complicated data munging task in and off itself to merge all of these into a single data frame. There are also a limited number of features offered by these, including financial information about the film, which is a feature of great interest for most data-driven business problems relating to film.\n",
    "IMDB remains a rich source of information, but this limited access to it inspired us to employ our python skills to develop a web scraper for pulling exactly the information we want from webpages for films. Along with determining all the features we want,  we also wanted to build a data set based on parameters of our choice, such as genre or year of release. A program that can effectively pull data sets of movies with any desired features or movie type would be useful for anyone who wants to do any kind of data analysis on films. The only limit is what kind of project the user can dream up. \n",
    "Another facet of our inspiration for this project is our dissatisfaction with the system of critic reviews and ratings. These metrics are biased and inconsistent, both across the spectrum of different critics and even within individual critics’ histories of publication. We will propose a new, data-driven method based on the data sets we can scrape from IMDB, and discuss the kinds of predictions we hope to be able to perform with this information. (we will address this after the description of our application)."

    "### Step 1: Extract urls from IMBD search\n",
    "[IMDB Search](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is motivated by the groups interest in movies and being able to pull some specific datasets for analysis on demand. While IMDB does have some datasets puiblicly available, they are small (at most 8 columns), and would require significant merging to obtain what we are going for. Further, there is no box office information in these datasets, and earnings is the most significant variable that we would like to analyze. Beyond insterest in this industry, this application is also motivated by the fact that web scraping is a valuable tool for every data scientist to have at their disposal. Any time there is a lack of data in a problem you are facing, there is potentially valuable information available somewhere on the internet, and being able to extract it, clean it, and test it's validity allows for solving problems that otherwise may seem unsolvable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in this application is to take an input search (link above) and return a list of urls: one for each movie that satisfies those parameters. To implement this function, we will need the help of a few libraries: BeautifulSoup, urllib, and webbrowser (for debugging). The first thing to do is just take a look at what the search returns in the actual webpage. The things that jump out are: the total number of movies that match the search listed at the top as well as there being 50 movies per page. Therefore, we know two important variables right off the bat: how many urls we expect to return and how many webpages we will have to iterate over to get them all. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function, therefore, will begin by creating a BeautifulSoup object (i.e. a parsed HTML file) of the search url by opening the search url with urllib. Right away, we extract the total number of films returned from this query using the find_all method in BeautifulSoup, replacing the comma with nothing, and converting the resulting string to an integer. We then print the number for the users reference. From here, we need to understand how to move through each page of the query. By looking at page two, we see that it is, fortunately, pretty simple. By just appending \"&start=n\" where n is some number, to the search url, we can look at a page with 50 entries, starting at the nth entry. Getting a list of these numbers is a simple list comprehension. \n",
    "\n",
    "From there, we iterate each of these urls, creating a new BeautifulSoup object each time, and grabbing all links from the page using the get and findall methods. From the list of links, we look for a specific string 'title/tt' that corresponds to movie webpages, add it to the list of final urls, checking to make sure it is not already there. Once it iterates through each page and adds all urls, a test is run to ensure that the number of movies in the search matches the length of the final url list. \n",
    "\n",
    "There was an issue initially with the length of the list exceeding the number of movies in the search, so some debugging was required.  In some cases, there was only one extra link, while in others there was more than 100. The webbrowser library was used to open every 50 links to see which page was adding extra information. In hindsight, a more efficient option may be to just print how many items were added to the list in each loop and look for values over 50. Regardless, the issue was that some movies had a link to sequels/prequels included with them. This did not show up on the webpage, but was included in the html file. Further, each valid url was listed 3 seperate times, one with an extra directory in the url. Since these were the only title links with a length of 4 when split on '/', that is ultimately how we filter out for valid urls. It also avoids checking for duplicate values in the list twice for a better optimized runtime."

    "### Step 2: Web Scraper\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the project we use web scraping to gather data about all of the query result movies from IMDB's web page in a format that will be usable for analysis. In particular, we want to collect information about movie title, movie's genres, country, language, filming location, production company, runtime, budget information, release date, directors, writers, stars acting in the movie, rating, review count and finally mpaa ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our goal is to scrape information from multiple webpages with the same html structure, first we had to understand the websites structure. To do this, we used Chrome's Developer tools to inspect the structure of only one page. By right clicking and hitting inspect you can see the HTML line that corresponds to the part of webpage you clicked at. There are lots of HTML lines nested within each tag and for each feature we found unique identifier of information we wanted to extract. Then, in order to get the content of the webpage, we downloaded the pages that we wanted to scrape by using the request library. The library makes a get request to IMDB's server and downloads the HTML contents of a given web page. After we run the request using requests.get method, we get back a response object that has a status_code, which equals to 200 if the page gets downloaded successfully. This enabled us to include error catching into our code and return a warning whenever web pages did not get downloaded successfully (status_code does not equal 200).  Next step is to extract relevant text from the downloaded HTML documents. We used BeautifulSoup library for to parse these documents. In order to do this, we first created an instance of the BeautifulSoup class, which gives us a BeautifulSoup object. BeautifulSoup object has a nested data structure. The tag objects within this nested structure allowed us to extract the relevant information. We used find_all method to find all instances of a tag in a webpage. Find_all returns a list, therefore we used list indexing to extract relevant text by using text method. We also used find_all method to extract by class, for example in line 39 we search for any div that has class being 'see-more inline canwrap'. Once we are able to uniquely identify how to get each piece of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "* we can loop through multiple urls\n",
    "* place get requests within the loop for each page\n",
    "* convert the response's html content to beautiful soup object\n",
    "* extract all containers from this object by using find_all method, if there is no information than continue to the next variable\n",
    "* use list indexing to access information\n",
    "* and save this information into pandas’ data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this process, we have a data frame with each row representing information on each movie scraped and each column corresponding to the variable we scraped. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the issues we had to deal with was not having all of the features present on each web page. For example, not all movies have information about genres, language, writers and etc. Therefore, we used try and except statements to scrape information when present and continue running the code when the information was missing."

    "### Step 3: Cleaning the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step of the project is to clean the data set and prepare it for data anlaysis. When the data is read in from the scraper, beautiful soup captures other elements the html code such as line breaks and tab characters that restricts our ability to gain any predictive insights from the data. Our goal in the cleaning of the data is three fold: All columns in the data frame should be of the appropriate data type will no 'bad characters', all place holders/category extenders should be removed and categorical features encoded when necessary. To do so we break the cleaning process into three functions: \n",
    "\n",
    "* clean_data \n",
    "* encode_genre\n",
    "* adjust_years\n",
    "\n",
    "The clean_data has three primary functionality:\n",
    "* The first is to remove all bad characters from columns. Numerical information to be cleaned is the runtime, budget, gross usa, rating out of 10, number of reviews, opening week sales and cululative sales. All the numerical columns are cleaned and cast as float. Title and release date are also cleaned to remove bad characters. \n",
    "* The second is to clean place holder and Nans. Place holder categorical variables are replaces with an empty string and Nans and filled with zero. \n",
    "* For the the purpose of this analysis, we drop rows that do not have financial data (open_week, cumulative, etc.) since these are key features in our analysis later\n",
    "\n",
    "The categorical feature we chose to encode is genre. This is done using the encode_genre function. Based on IMDBs website description, there are a finite and countable number of genres to encode. For actors, writers and directors, we realized that there is the potential for an extremely large number of feature encoding since these features are mostly unique. Here we use the get_dummies function in pandas in conjunction with aggregating of genere to create a binary column for each genere label.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step in the process is the adjust_years funtion. For the purpose of our analysis we only want the years the movie was released. It is important to note that this procedure can be extended to involve months if there is analysis that requires this.  "
